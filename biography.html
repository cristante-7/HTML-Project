        <h2 style= text-align:center  >BACKROUND</h2>
        <p> <b><i>Chris Acqua Amoa</i></b> is my name. I am a third-year student at Ghana Communication Technology University. I am a conscientious and punctual student. 
          Life's journey is full of ups and downs. If today is not a good day for us, we must have optimism that everything will be well very soon.
           During difficult circumstances, we must never give up. As a result, in life, constantly attempt to appreciate what you have. 
           Discover your calling and strive to be more helpful every day. Furthermore, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I enjoy communicating with others and getting to know new and intriguing people..</p> 

            

                <p>The goal I’m currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself. Sure, 
                    I’ve had bad experiences in my life too, but this is exactly what made me the way I am now: grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life.
                     I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsibility for what I do and where I go. With all I already have,
                      I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well.</p>
